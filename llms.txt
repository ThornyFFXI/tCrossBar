# Project Name

## tCrossBar

## Description
tCrossBar is an Ashita addon (Final Fantasy XI) that provides a configurable cross-bar / controller UI and input-mapping layer. It exposes controller layouts, per-class ability/spell/weapon-skill mappings, and a lightweight GUI for binding and configuring inputs. The addon supports multiple controller profiles and dynamic layout switching based on player state.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Lua (targeted for Ashita/FFXI addon environment)
- Runtime: Ashita (in-game addon host)
- UI/Fonts: bundled `gdifonts` helpers

## Architecture
The project is organized to separate UI, controller input, configuration, and game-state updates.

- Core:
	- `tCrossBar.lua`: addon entry-point and main loop
	- `initializer.lua`: initialization and registration with Ashita
	- `interface.lua`: glue between game events and addon components

- Controller & Input:
	- `controller.lua`: controller detection and mapping
	- `bindings.lua`: persistent binding storage and lookup
	- `bindinggui.lua`, `configgui.lua`: in-game configuration UIs

- UI Elements / Displays:
	- `element.lua`: base UI element definitions
	- `singledisplay.lua`, `doubledisplay.lua`, `expandeddisplay.lua`: visual layouts
	- `texturecache.lua`: texture/font caching utilities

- Game Integration:
	- `callbacks.lua`, `commands.lua`: Ashita callbacks and slash commands
	- `updaters/`: per-type updaters (ability, spell, item, trust, weaponskill, etc.)
	- `state/`: tracked game state (player, inventory, skillchain)

- Resources:
	- `resources/`: controller profiles, layouts, ability/spell/weapon-skill metadata
	- `gdifonts/`: font and encoding helpers

## Installation
1. Copy the `tCrossBar` folder into your Ashita `addons` directory.
2. Start the game and load the addon with your Ashita command (e.g., `/addon load tCrossBar`).
3. Configure bindings in-game via the configuration GUI or by editing resource layout files.

## Development
- Lua style: keep code simple and modular; follow existing project conventions.
- To test: run Ashita + FFXI, load the addon, and exercise the UI and controller mappings.
- The project is Windows-friendly; development edits can be reloaded in-game with the addon reload command.

## Contributing
- Open issues and PRs for bug reports and feature requests.
- Prefer small, focused changes and include usage notes for new features.
